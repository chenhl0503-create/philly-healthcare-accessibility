# Results

This section answers **RQ1–RQ3** using the final E2SFCA accessibility surfaces, Medicaid equity gaps, and priority-based siting logic.

---

## 1. The Medicaid equity gap (RQ2)

The map shows **percentage accessibility loss** when the network is restricted to **Medicaid-accepting facilities only**. Darker areas indicate tracts where a large share of E2SFCA access is lost due to insurance acceptance constraints.

## 2. Neighborhood typologies (RQ2)

The scatter plot summarizes clustering results on accessibility and SVI:

- **Privileged**, low SVI, high access  
- **Supported**, high SVI, high access  
- **Moderate**, high SVI, mid access  
- **Critical deserts**, high SVI, low access  

This supports the interpretation that meaningful access is shaped by capacity and Medicaid acceptance, not distance alone.

---

## 3. Priority index and site recommendations (RQ3)

To guide intervention, the project defines a **Priority Index**:

$$
Priority\ Index = Normalized\ Equity\ Gap \times Normalized\ SVI
$$

High values flag tracts that are both highly vulnerable and lose a large share of access under Medicaid constraints.

### Embedded interactive explorer (for siting context)

Notes:

- Use the metric selector in the dashboard to view **Weighted Impact (Priority Index)** and **Equity Gap**.
- The siting logic focuses on the upper tail of the Priority Index distribution to identify clusters of critical deserts.
