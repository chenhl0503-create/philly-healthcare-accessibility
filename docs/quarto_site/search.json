    "text": "Project Overview\nCOVID-19 acted as a stress test for urban healthcare systems. When mobility is restricted, traditional metrics such as “20-minute driving catchments” become unrealistic for low-income, carless, and essential workers.\nThis project investigates the Philadelphia Paradox: a city with world-class hospitals (Penn, Jefferson) that still suffers from severe health disparities by neighborhood and race. Moving beyond simple Euclidean distance, the analysis uses an Enhanced Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (E2SFCA) model to quantify the gap between:\n\nTheoretical access: all hospitals reachable on a driving network\n\nActual access: the subset of facilities that accept Medicaid, for socially vulnerable populations"
