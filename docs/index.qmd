## Project Overview

COVID-19 acted as a stress test for urban healthcare systems. When mobility is restricted, traditional metrics such as “20-minute driving catchments” become unrealistic for low-income, carless, and essential workers.

This project investigates the **Philadelphia Paradox**: a city with world-class hospitals (Penn, Jefferson) that still suffers from severe health disparities by neighborhood and race. Moving beyond simple Euclidean distance, the analysis uses an **Enhanced Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (E2SFCA)** model to quantify the gap between:

- **Theoretical access:** all hospitals reachable on a driving network  
- **Actual access:** the subset of facilities that accept Medicaid, for socially vulnerable populations
