It is valuable for teaching and communication, but it is not sufficient for serious policy guidance.\n\nOptional extensions\n\nLevel 3 [a light MCLP style siting of three to five facilities] is implemented as scenario analysis. It helps explore intervention options, but it is not required to answer the core diagnostic and equity questions.\nLevel 5 [predictive or robust optimization] is outlined as future work, for example using machine learning to infer hidden demand or simple stochastic models of surge events.\n\nMessage for the committee\nLevels 2 and 4 form the smallest, necessary combination that fully answers RQ1 and RQ2 for this thesis.\nLevel 1 anchors the analysis in intuitive baselines, while Levels 3 and 5 define a realistic longer term research agenda that can be pursued beyond this project."
