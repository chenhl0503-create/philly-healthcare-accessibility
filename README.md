Beyond Distance: Spatial Accessibility and Equity of Healthcare During COVID-19A Case Study of PhiladelphiaAuthor: Haolong Chen📖 Project OverviewCOVID-19 acted as a "stress test" for urban healthcare systems. When mobility is restricted, traditional metrics like "20-minute driving catchments" become unrealistic for low-income, car-less, and essential workers.This project investigates the "Philadelphia Paradox": a city with world-class hospitals (UPenn, Jefferson) that still suffers from severe health disparities by neighborhood and race. Moving beyond simple Euclidean distance, this research uses the Enhanced Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (E2SFCA) method to quantify the disparity between theoretical access (all hospitals) and actual access (Medicaid-accepting facilities) for vulnerable populations.🎯 Research QuestionsDiagnosis: How does spatial accessibility vary when measured using realistic road networks and capacity constraints?Equity: Is accessibility equitably distributed, or does it systematically disadvantage socially vulnerable groups?Intervention: Where should new facilities be located to maximize impact for the most vulnerable?🛠 MethodologyThis project employs a multi-level spatial analysis framework using Python:Level 1 (Baseline): Nearest Neighbor Drive Time analysis using OpenStreetMap (OSM) networks.Level 2 (Core Analysis): Implementation of E2SFCA (Enhanced 2-Step Floating Catchment Area) with Gaussian distance decay to measure supply-to-demand ratios.Correction: Application of buffer zones (including hospitals in NJ and PA suburbs) to eliminate Edge Effects.Level 3 (Equity): Integration of the CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) to identify "Medical Deserts" (High SVI + Low Access).Level 4 (Optimization): Development of a "Priority Index" (Gap × SVI) to recommend sites for new facilities.📂 Repository StructurePlaintext├── Data/                                   # Raw geospatial and tabular data inputs

📊 Key FindingsThe Distance Myth: Regression analysis ($R^2 \approx 0$) shows that physical distance is not the primary barrier to care in Philadelphia.The Inner-City Paradox: University City and Center City act as "Medical Hubs" (High SVI + High Resources), where barriers are financial (insurance) rather than spatial.The True Deserts: The Northeast and Southwest sections of Philadelphia are identified as "Triple Threat" zones: High SVI, High Travel Time, and Low Access.Medicaid Gap: Vulnerable populations face a significant accessibility penalty when limited strictly to Medicaid-accepting facilities.💾 Data SourcesSupply: OpenDataPhilly (Hospitals), CMS Hospital Compare (Capacity/Beds), Scraped data for NJ/PA suburban hospitals.Demand: US Census ACS 2021 (Population), WorldPop 2020 (Grid validation).Equity: CDC ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) 2020.Network: OpenStreetMap (OSM) via OSMnx Python library.Policy: HUD Qualified Census Tracts (QCT).🚀 How to RunClone this repository.Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed (key dependencies: geopandas, osmnx, networkx, matplotlib, seaborn, panel, hvplot).Run the Final_beta.ipynb notebook to reproduce the data processing, E2SFCA calculations, and visualization generation.🗺️ Project WebsiteFor an interactive explanation of the process, visualizations, and detailed results, please visit the project website:[Link to your GitHub Pages Website] (Note: Please ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in the repository settings)
