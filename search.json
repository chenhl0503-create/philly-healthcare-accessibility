Even when realistic road network travel times are used, variations in spatial accessibility will not be primarily driven by physical distance to hospitals, but by capacity constraints and spatial mismatches between supply and demand.\nH2 [The Medicaid gap]. Vulnerable populations will face a significant accessibility penalty when limited to Medicaid accepting facilities, confirming structural inequity.\nH3 [Targeted optimization]. Siting new facilities based on a multi criteria “Gap Index” that combines population with SVI will be more effective than traditional density based planning."

It is valuable for teaching and communication, but it is not sufficient for serious policy guidance.\n\nOptional extensions\n\nLevel 3 [a light MCLP style siting of three to five facilities] is implemented as scenario analysis. It helps explore intervention options, but it is not required to answer the core diagnostic and equity questions.\nLevel 5 [predictive or robust optimization] is outlined as future work, for example using machine learning to infer hidden demand or simple stochastic models of surge events.\n\nMessage for the committee\nLevels 2 and 4 form the smallest, necessary combination that fully answers RQ1 and RQ2 for this thesis.\nLevel 1 anchors the analysis in intuitive baselines, while Levels 3 and 5 define a realistic longer term research agenda that can be pursued beyond this project."
